# D3 Webpack Starterkit

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/mariofink/d3-webpack-starterkit.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This is a D3 playground based on Webpack. It comes with support for:

* next generation JavaScript/ECMAScript with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)-based stylesheet
* hot-reloading [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) development server

## Requirements

You need to have a current version of [node.js with npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

## Setup

Create a clone of this repository and install the dependencies on the command-line:

    git clone https://github.com/mariofink/d3-webpack-starterkit.git
    cd d3-webpack-starterkit
    npm install

## Running the development server

To start Webpack’s development server, run this on the command-line:

    npm start

You can now go to http://localhost:9000 in your browser and you should see the “Hello, world!” message.

## Changing code

All necessary code can be found in the src directory. If you make any changes to the code while the development server is running, then you will immediately see the update in your browser. Thanks, Webpack 🙇‍♂️
